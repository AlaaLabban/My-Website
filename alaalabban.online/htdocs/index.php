  <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website!</h2>
  <p>This website was created as part of my CPCS403 Internet Applications final project. It demonstrates my understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL integration.</p>

  <p>Here's what you’ll find on this site:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📅 A full weekly class schedule with print support</li>
    <li>📸 A picture gallery with 10 aircraft images</li>
    <li>🎬 A YouTube video embedded directly in the page</li>
    <li>📝 A feedback form with JavaScript and server-side validation</li>
    <li>📄 A resume viewer embedded using the object tag</li>
    <li>📬 A contact page with JavaScript email obfuscation</li>
    <li>💻 A live WordPress blog (blog subdomain)</li>
    <li>🗃️ A PHP-powered database view with two related tables</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My name is Alaa Labban. I'm a student at King Abdulaziz University, passionate about technology, design, and football ⚽.</p>

  <p>This website was built to apply what I learned in CPCS403, and to show how real-world technologies come together in a live site.</p>
